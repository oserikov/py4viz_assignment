# graded assignment
write a one-page paper in **english** on lemurs. your paper should **NOT** have any abstract; there should be **one section only**, called "Lemurs survey".

You should provide **two figures** there. One of them should provide the **histogram** of lemurs taxons present in the dataset. Another should provide the **violin** plot on the distribution of the lemurs' weights.

Both of your charts as well as the latex document should **use serif font**. Do not italicize nor bold text on chart.
Use the [attached .ttf file](https://github.com/oserikov/py4viz_assignment/blob/master/Times%20New%20Roman.ttf) in matplotlib and seaborn to configure the charts font to be Times New Roman in python (see [docs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/font_file.html) for examples). 
In case of failure with .ttf , use the default serif font. 
Provide figures with **captions in latex** and do **NOT** provide figure titles in python and remember to **provide axes with labels**.

In your paper, please provide the description of the typical averaged lemur: which is her most probable taxon?; what is the expected weight; how old is she? Refer to your figures to support your claims on taxon and weight.

Please find one paper on lemurs on google scholar and **cite it** in your latex file. Ensure it appears in the biblography.
Please, **re-use the COLING2022 overleaf latex template** for your needs, you can find it here ([link])[https://coling2022.org/Submission].


I will not evaluate statistics nor the adequacy of your texts.
