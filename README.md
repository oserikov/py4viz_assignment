> [Data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-05-17/eurovision.csv)


You should provide **two figures** there.You should provide two figures there. With **scatterplot** vizualize the relation bween running order and the rank of your artist.  Provide a **heatmap** where the X axis is the year of the event, Y axis is the country, and cell colour/hue the country rank at the given year.

Both of your charts as well as the latex document should **use serif font**. Do not italicize nor bold text on chart.
Use the [attached .ttf file](https://github.com/oserikov/py4viz_assignment/blob/master/Times%20New%20Roman.ttf) in matplotlib and seaborn to configure the charts font to be Times New Roman in python (see [docs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/font_file.html) for examples). 
In case of failure with .ttf , use the default serif font. 
Provide figures with **captions in latex** and do **NOT** provide figure titles in python and remember to **provide axes with labels**.



In your paper, try to answer whether the artist running order matters in eurovision? Refer to your figures to support your claims.
Please find one paper on songs stats on google scholar and cite it in your latex file. Ensure it appears in the biblography.
Please, **re-use the COLING2022 overleaf latex template** for your needs, you can find it here [link](https://coling2022.org/Submission).


I will not evaluate statistics nor the adequacy of your texts. One page is the upper bound of the paper's size, feel free to make it as short as needed.
